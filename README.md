Please leave a star on the repo if you found this useful ðŸ˜„

How to view: You could pull the repo and use your preferred markdown editor/viewer (I use Typora, and I hear VSCode is pretty good too) - this would yield the best viewing experience. If not, you could also just download the associated PDF, this was exported from the Markdown so I can't guarantee the quality.

Disclaimer: These notes were made for my review purposes, please use them with discretion - trust them as much as you would trust any other random undergrad.
