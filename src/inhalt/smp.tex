\begin{itemize} %[itemsep=0ex,topsep=-2ex]
    \item instability: say $(m, w')$ is instable if 
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin = 1em]
        \item $m$ prefers $w'$ more than his current $w$, and
        \item $w'$ prefers $m$ more than her current partner $m'$
    \end{itemize}
    \item note: the set S returned by GS is unique, even if 
    there's more than one perfect pairing
    \item runtime: $\Theta(n^2)$
\end{itemize}
